# Foafnaut desktop frame pipeline: input, Lean frame build, GPU (2026-11-07)

Tracking: https://github.com/danbri/factoidal/issues/1268 (responsiveness and frame time).
Owner, 2026-11-07, verbatim: "Goal set: much faster perf, responsive, never miss a click!"

## Threads

- **Main thread** (Cocoa requires it): the native window library (`native_window.m`), the
  event pump, input handling, the GPU device and surface, and a Wasm engine for small calls
  only (`shellHit`, `hit`, `pointerUp`, `command`, history, address bar text). Each small
  call is timed; a call over 2 ms is traced as `native-html-slow-call`.
- **Engine worker** (`native_html_worker.ts`, `native_html_compile.ts`): one ordered queue of
  every slow Lean call (`render` compile, graph start, event and page, selected text, XSLT,
  inspect, font load, font requests). All Lean calls for a document run on this one thread,
  because the Lean runtime state (the held font) is not shared between threads.

## Engine backends

The worker calls `call(html, requestJSON, width, height) -> string`, from one of:

- the Wasm engine (`web-render.wasm`), and
- the native library `libweb-render.dylib`, opened through Deno FFI. `build-web-render.sh
  --native` links it from the same objects as `web-render-native` and the same C shim as
  the Wasm build, with a static Lean runtime. The release package puts it beside the
  window program; with no library, or with `--wasm-engine`, the worker uses Wasm.

Measured 2026-11-07, 1600 by 1200, Noto Sans, 5 pages: the native output is the same
bytes as the Wasm output. Frame build time is 1.6 to 1.9 times less (status page 99.5 ms
against 162.6 ms; index 11.7 ms against 19.5 ms).

## Input

- The window library queue grows (to 65,536 events, then it counts refusals in
  `ng_events_dropped`). No click, key or other discrete event is dropped. Adjacent moves and
  resizes keep the newest position; adjacent scroll steps add up.
  `native_window_queue_test.ts` checks this with 5,000 rounds of mixed events.
- Each event carries the time it was queued (`ng_event_clock`). Input latency
  (`native-html-input-latency`) runs from that time to the present of the first frame that
  includes the effect of the event.
- Graph input is queued in order. Moves, resizes and clock ticks not yet started merge, the
  newest wins; presses, releases and keys never merge.

## GPU

- One session per window. The pipeline is rebuilt only when the WGSL or the pipeline
  description changes; buffers are recreated only when they must grow; the surface is
  reconfigured only on a size change.
- An interactive frame does not read pixels back. The readback, the pixel check and the
  FNV hash run on every frame with `--check-pixels` and in sweeps, and in normal use once,
  500 ms after input stops, on the frame on screen (`native-html-checked`).
  `--idle-checks-only` gives a sweep the normal-use rule.

## Measurements (2026-11-07, Apple silicon laptop, 1600 by 1000)

- GPU session per frame: 26 ms before, 1 ms after.
- Draw of an unchecked frame: 2.6 ms (a checked frame: about 46 ms).
- Time the window takes no input (pump gap) after the first frame, `--idle-checks-only`:
  p50 about 10 ms, max 14 to 37 ms. Before: at least the whole frame, 100 to 290 ms.
- Click to present, from queue time, command sweep: 337 ms (Wasm) and 200 ms (native)
  before; 52 ms (Wasm) and 41 ms (native) after. Graph click: 179 ms before; 118 ms (Wasm)
  and 94 ms (native) after. These sweeps have 1 or 2 events each, so these are single
  readings, not percentiles.

## Open

- Scroll redoes the Lean frame build. Plan: the page is drawn into a texture that is the
  window height plus 512 px above and below (the scene already keeps only items in that
  band), the chrome is a second layer, and a scroll step inside the band only moves the
  texture offset. A theorem states that drawing a translated scene equals drawing the
  scene and then moving the image.
- A graph click needs two worker calls (graph event, then graph page) before the frame
  build. Passing the graph scene to the engine without SVG text removes the second.
- No press state is drawn before Lean answers.
